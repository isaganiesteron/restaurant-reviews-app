## Create a interface to grab Restaurant reviews from google maps by a keyword

Using the Google APIs, create a mini project that gets as input a location (location + country) and a keyword ("breakfast" or "dinner with a view") and finds all the restaurants in the area that have this keyword in them.

After that for the top 10 restaurants, find 10 reviews of each (or less if not possible) containing the keywords. Feed the 10 reviews to an AI (chat GPT for now) and get it to write a short review / description of the place.
