					text: "\"Delicious Corn Dog and Hotdog Delight at John's Famous Hotdog\"\n\nToday I had the pleasure of visiting John's Famous Hotdog at Time Square NYC and I must say, I was blown away by their incredible hot dog and corn dogs! As a connoisseur of carnival classics, I have to admit that John's Famous Hotdog has truly mastered the art of the Hot and Corn dog.\nThe first thing that struck me was the welcoming atmosphere of the establishment. The friendly staff made me feel right at home, and their passion for their craft was evident from the moment I arrived.\nNow, let's talk about the star of the show – the corn dog itself. The batter was perfectly golden and crispy, providing a delightful crunch with every bite. The hotdog inside was juicy and flavorful, and the ratio of batter to dog was spot on. I could tell that they use high-quality ingredients, and the care that goes into making each corn dog is truly remarkable.\n\nWhat's more, the variety of dipping sauces available allowed me to customize my corn dog experience to my liking. From classic mustard to zesty barbecue sauce, there was something for everyone.\n\nThe cherry on top of this exceptional experience was the reasonable pricing. I felt that I got fantastic value for my money, especially considering the generous portion sizes.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're in the mood for a top-notch hotdog or corn dog, look no further than John's Famous Hotdog. Whether you're a longtime corn dog enthusiast or just looking to indulge in a delicious treat, you won't be disappointed. I can't wait to return and savor another one of their amazing corn dogs!",

					text: "I am not sure how am I just now writing a review for Crif Dogs as we've been coming here since 2002, but it clearly says something that this has been my go-to place for the best veggie dog in the city for nearly twenty years!!! Yes, 18 years ago this was more of a late night spot after being out late, but it has now become a place where we still enjoy stopping in for some veggie dogs and perfectly made tots. It's a small space, and \"back-in-the-day\" the speakeasy was actually a speakeasy that not many people knew about and we had a blast learning about it and going. It's now become popular and more people come for that than the food at times, but it's still a wonderful cozy spot with great service! Our most recent visit was just as great as our first. The service has always been exceptional here - they are kind, welcoming and always get the order right. It may take a little longer for your food to come out, but it's worth the wait. Don't come here expecting \"fast food\". It's quality food made fresh and with love. We are vegetarian so our base will always be the veggie dog, but we love changing up our toppings. Since we're originally from Chicago, we like to make it Chicago-style once in a while, thankfully we don't get any flack for that :). The tots make the perfect pairing! I love the East Village tots most, mainly because they are spicy, but the Truffle Shuffle is quite good too. Honestly, I am not sure when the menu changed to just tots, I am pretty sure it used to be waffle fries...anyhow, I digress. Be sure to stop in whether you're just passing through NYC or live here and haven't been yet!",

					text: "Probably the best Hot Dog I’ve had in New York City!\n\nTheir all-beef hot dog franks are high quality and flavorful, with the signature snappiness and crispness of a good New York hot dog. I ordered the Recession Special (2 hot dogs + a drink for $6.45) and also topped my hot dogs with chile, cheese, onions, and relish! For drinks, I really enjoyed their papaya juice, which they make in-house from scratch. Overall, it’s a great deal if you’re looking for a quick lunch or afternoon snack in the city.",

					text: "“The best hotdogs in New York”\n\nAfter spending time researching where to get a hot dog in New York it came down to Grays Papaya and Bilies Hotdog Cart. I chose here as this was a little closer, and I’m sure glad I chose it.\n\nThe hot dogs were delicious with loads of flavour and the papaya drink a was nice and  cold and lovely sweet flavour.\n\nI got the Addicted which is 3 hot dogs and a large drink for about $10 which I thought was good value. I enjoyed it so much I got another one straight after.\n\nTaste: the hotdog was grilled perfectly and the beans and cheese was the perfect combination for the flavour hit. The papaya flavoured drink is sweet and maybe not for everyone.\n\nService: The service was quick and friendly.\n\nStaff: Very friendly and helpful.\n\nPrice: Well priced\n\nValue: Great\n\nCleanliness: It was very clean behind the counter and inside looked clean too.\n\nLocation: We stayed downtown so it took us quite a while to get up to the store which is solidly uptown. There’s probably an easier way to get there (train/bus) but I thought the location is good as it’s not near Times Square or any ridiculously busy spot.\n\nThe wait: I waited less than 5 minutes for my first serving and less than 2 minutes when I ordered again.  This was around 2pm. I am sure it’s a lot busier at lunchtime.\n\nWould I go back: Absolutely\nWould I recommend going: If you want a hot dog in New York City this is the place to go!!!",

When we got there, the two nice, young and hardworking girls were moving fast get open. They told us they were short and would be opening a half hour late. With this news, our NYC hot dog goals were dashed since we needed to get to airport. I told the girl we would not be able to wait and had to go. She must have took pity, and asked if I could pay with card and allowed us to order. It was one of our favorite meals while there!

It’s just what you would expect from appearances and delivers on crunch and rich batter flavor, however the uber thick crispy/soft batter with a just-okay hotdog plus the recommended sugar and sauce makes it so rich, so greasy, and so sweet it’s hard to eat the whole thing (coming from someone who can eat 4 donuts without thinking). As for ordering, the kiosk is easy and fine, place smells like a fryer. Prices decent. Service speed is solid, 5 min per dog.

The restaurant is mostly take away since it is pretty small. They have a small handful of outdoor seating available.\n\nI got a mixture of fruit punch and lemonade slushie. The slushie was tasty but tasted like regular boxed Minute Maid/Koolaid drinks and not something freshly made.\n\nThe corn dog was made fresh to order and was tasty. The sweet and savory combination was an interesting mix. The kimchi fries came out hot and fresh. They had condiments available but it was tasty by itself.\n\nThe tiny outpost only had two people on staff. One person who took orders and set them up and one cook. The cashier was very friendly and nice. The orders came out in a decent speed.",

The restaurant is mostly take away since it is pretty small. They have a small handful of outdoor seating available.\n\nI got a mixture of fruit punch and lemonade slushie. The slushie was tasty but tasted like regular boxed Minute Maid/Koolaid drinks and not something freshly made.\n\nThe corn dog was made fresh to order and was tasty. The sweet and savory combination was an interesting mix. The kimchi fries came out hot and fresh. They had condiments available but it was tasty by itself.\n\nThe tiny outpost only had two people on staff. One person who took orders and set them up and one cook. The cashier was very friendly and nice. The orders came out in a decent speed.",

The Toast was very good, and so was the hot dog, but the Potato Hot Dogs did look tastier. They had a variety of seasonings and sauces to spice up your food, which was great, but it did take a while to prepare the food, and we waited for about 15 minutes. It was still very tasty and cured our late-night munchies!",

					text: "+ The hotdog is ridiculously good! Every bite is like repeating 3 senses, you first feel the ultra crunchiness of the rice shell, then you feel the chewy texture of the shell (in a positive way) and last you taste the well seasoned rice shell and the juicy beef hotdog! Prolly the best hotdog I’ve ever had!\n\n~ The service is a bit slow as they need to make every order fresh to ensure the crunchiness I guess. It took me about 10 mins from placing the order to receiving my food.\n\n- This is just a storefront with no tables or chairs to eat. Next to the store, half dozen trash bags were thrown on the side wall. I guess the expectation is you eat your hotdog as you walk away, which is not unreasonable for hotdog.\n\nWill I come back? Yes!",

					text: "We happened across this place after a trip to the city. I've always wanted to try Korean dogs and was delighted to find this little spot. Ordered the #7 (half mozzarella & half hot dog w/ potato exterior) $7.61. And I think the #10 (full mozzarella only w/ potato exterior). Oh and while they were piping hot, they rolled it in regular white sugar. There's a choice to coat with both white sugar and/or cinnamon sugar, but the white sugar was far better with an added sweetness, but subtle flavor. Go with the white sugar coating only.\n\nAnd the dipping sauces, so many to choose from. They were all delicious. I tried the sweet chili, honey mustard and garlic sauce with my Korean Dog. Just Amazing punch of flavors!\n\nAt first bite, the crunchy potatoes were delicious! Immediately followed by the famous cheese pull. Either I was really starving or it was really that good. Honestly, I couldn't imagine how yummy it was. The half mozz & half dog was nice, however, the hotdog was a little gross because of the soft texture. It didn't seem like a superior hot dog. The focus was more on the exterior. So, with a better hotdog, this would be 10/10. The full mozz was nice, but then it was missing that savory combination. I think bacon would have been lovely with it.\n\nAnd full disclaimer! This is LES ( lower east side), so the area is grimey. There is no where to sit, just a graffitied standing area with a pet pigeon..lol.\n\nAll and all, the cashier was sooo friendly and kind. He honestly made it for a better experience. He took his time to explain the menu and helped us choose some faves.\n\nGiving this spot a 4.2. Will be back.",

The staff was polite but a huge peeve of mine is when you\nPlace an order and the person accepting the money doesn’t tell you the total. I’m handing him a $10 bill and he just looks to take the money. I asked and he told me $6. Which for a store front isn’t a bad price to pay. The hot dogs were a little disappointing because they just didn’t seem to have the really good snap that you expect. It did have one, but it just wasn’t the normal “snap” that you get when you bite in. The bread was very basic. I’d rate the hot dog a 6.5-7 the max. I sent back in to give the sausage a try. I must say I was expecting to lay at least $5 but it was only $3.50. The sausage had some really good heat to it. The bread was just okay, would probably take this dog to another level is they put it on the grill for a minute or so. They accept card with a minimum of $6 purchase",

Not sure why it’s considered best hotdog in New York. Meat is flavourful but skin a bit tough and hot dog super tiny. Bread was cold. Vendor squeezes a thin lie or cheese or chili so not worth the upgrade for cheese or chili dogs. Chips are good thick cut although vendor poured salt on ours. $8 for fries? Why? Just disappointed as a tourist food trucks should be either cheap or great tasting it was neither. Would not go again.",

I personally love their lemonade more than anything. I think their mozzarella dog is the only one I actually like but can't have more than two bites as I can't eat cheese that much. The toasts are hit or miss. I think that because they use condensed milk it is an acquired taste for some. I like savory stuff so having sweet on it isn't my cup of tea. Still great spot for a quick snack for the kiddos.",

The buns are soft and pillowy, and the sausages themselves are bursting with juicy, savory flavor. But what really sets Dyckman Dogs apart is the toppings. Each hotdog is piled high with a dizzying array of ingredients - from crispy bacon to tangy sauerkraut to creamy avocado. It's like a party in your mouth with every bite.\n\nBut don't think for a second that Dyckman Dogs is a one-trick pony. Their burger and beer selection is equally exceptional. The burgers are thick and juicy, and come with all the classic fixings - plus some inventive extras that will make your taste buds sing. And their beer selection is carefully curated, with options that will please both casual sippers and serious craft beer aficionados.\n\nDespite the amazing food and drink offerings, what really sets Dyckman Dogs apart is the laid-back, welcoming atmosphere. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and the vibe is chill and unpretentious. This is the kind of place where you can hang out with friends, watch the game, and enjoy some seriously delicious eats.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a truly exceptional hotdog (or burger, or beer), Dyckman Dogs is the place to be. Trust me, Anthony Bourdain would have approved.",

All of the food came iced cold, they placed cold drinks on top of the food, and messed up the order itself with the wrong ingredients. As soon as the food arrived the manager of the establishment was called. He was extremely rude, immediately stated that he will do zero in a terrible manner to correct the order. I nicely asked him again if the order could be replaced, after three or four times of this he stayed silent. DO NOT under any circumstances go to this establishment as you will probably receive cold/incorrect food and unbelievably rude service.",
