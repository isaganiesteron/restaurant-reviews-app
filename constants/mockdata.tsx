We got the mustard, sauerkraut and onion sauce to try it the way they do in nyc, and it was pretty good!  maybe would have taken off the onion sauce but I liked the mustard and sauerkraut a lot. The hot dog itself was also really good, and the person preparing was friendly and fast. The cost is a bit steep and I wouldn’t say it’s worth it over other hot dogs I’ve had so that’s why 4/5, but if you’re in the area it’s probably the best for that vicinity!",

					text: "\"Delicious Corn Dog and Hotdog Delight at John's Famous Hotdog\"\n\nToday I had the pleasure of visiting John's Famous Hotdog at Time Square NYC and I must say, I was blown away by their incredible hot dog and corn dogs! As a connoisseur of carnival classics, I have to admit that John's Famous Hotdog has truly mastered the art of the Hot and Corn dog.\nThe first thing that struck me was the welcoming atmosphere of the establishment. The friendly staff made me feel right at home, and their passion for their craft was evident from the moment I arrived.\nNow, let's talk about the star of the show – the corn dog itself. The batter was perfectly golden and crispy, providing a delightful crunch with every bite. The hotdog inside was juicy and flavorful, and the ratio of batter to dog was spot on. I could tell that they use high-quality ingredients, and the care that goes into making each corn dog is truly remarkable.\n\nWhat's more, the variety of dipping sauces available allowed me to customize my corn dog experience to my liking. From classic mustard to zesty barbecue sauce, there was something for everyone.\n\nThe cherry on top of this exceptional experience was the reasonable pricing. I felt that I got fantastic value for my money, especially considering the generous portion sizes.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're in the mood for a top-notch hotdog or corn dog, look no further than John's Famous Hotdog. Whether you're a longtime corn dog enthusiast or just looking to indulge in a delicious treat, you won't be disappointed. I can't wait to return and savor another one of their amazing corn dogs!",

					text: "Probably the best Hot Dog I’ve had in New York City!\n\nTheir all-beef hot dog franks are high quality and flavorful, with the signature snappiness and crispness of a good New York hot dog. I ordered the Recession Special (2 hot dogs + a drink for $6.45) and also topped my hot dogs with chile, cheese, onions, and relish! For drinks, I really enjoyed their papaya juice, which they make in-house from scratch. Overall, it’s a great deal if you’re looking for a quick lunch or afternoon snack in the city.",

					text: "“The best hotdogs in New York”\n\nAfter spending time researching where to get a hot dog in New York it came down to Grays Papaya and Bilies Hotdog Cart. I chose here as this was a little closer, and I’m sure glad I chose it.\n\nThe hot dogs were delicious with loads of flavour and the papaya drink a was nice and  cold and lovely sweet flavour.\n\nI got the Addicted which is 3 hot dogs and a large drink for about $10 which I thought was good value. I enjoyed it so much I got another one straight after.\n\nTaste: the hotdog was grilled perfectly and the beans and cheese was the perfect combination for the flavour hit. The papaya flavoured drink is sweet and maybe not for everyone.\n\nService: The service was quick and friendly.\n\nStaff: Very friendly and helpful.\n\nPrice: Well priced\n\nValue: Great\n\nCleanliness: It was very clean behind the counter and inside looked clean too.\n\nLocation: We stayed downtown so it took us quite a while to get up to the store which is solidly uptown. There’s probably an easier way to get there (train/bus) but I thought the location is good as it’s not near Times Square or any ridiculously busy spot.\n\nThe wait: I waited less than 5 minutes for my first serving and less than 2 minutes when I ordered again.  This was around 2pm. I am sure it’s a lot busier at lunchtime.\n\nWould I go back: Absolutely\nWould I recommend going: If you want a hot dog in New York City this is the place to go!!!",

As for ordering, the kiosk is easy and fine, place smells like a fryer. Prices decent. Service speed is solid, 5 min per dog.

It took me about 10 mins from placing the order to receiving my food.\n\n- This is just a storefront with no tables or chairs to eat.

Ordered the #7 (half mozzarella & half hot dog w/ potato exterior) $7.61. And I think the #10 (full mozzarella only w/ potato exterior). Oh and while they were piping hot, they rolled it in regular white sugar. There's a choice to coat with both white sugar and/or cinnamon sugar, but the white sugar was far better with an added sweetness, but subtle flavor. Go with the white sugar coating only.\n\nAnd the dipping sauces, so many to choose from. They were all delicious. I tried the sweet chili, honey mustard and garlic sauce with my Korean Dog. Just Amazing punch of flavors!\n\nAt first bite, the crunchy potatoes were delicious! Immediately followed by the famous cheese pull. Either I was really starving or it was really that good. Honestly, I couldn't imagine how yummy it was. The half mozz & half dog was nice, however, the hotdog was a little gross because of the soft texture. It didn't seem like a superior hot dog. The focus was more on the exterior. So, with a better hotdog, this would be 10/10. The full mozz was nice, but then it was missing that savory combination. I think bacon would have been lovely with it.\n\nAnd full disclaimer! This is LES ( lower east side), so the area is grimey. There is no where to sit, just a graffitied standing area with a pet pigeon..lol.\n\nAll and all, the cashier was sooo friendly and kind. He honestly made it for a better experience. He took his time to explain the menu and helped us choose some faves.\n\nGiving this spot a 4.2. Will be back.",

The staff was polite but a huge peeve of mine is when you\nPlace an order and the person accepting the money doesn’t tell you the total. I’m handing him a $10 bill and he just looks to take the money. I asked and he told me $6. Which for a store front isn’t a bad price to pay. The hot dogs were a little disappointing because they just didn’t seem to have the really good snap that you expect. It did have one, but it just wasn’t the normal “snap” that you get when you bite in. The bread was very basic. I’d rate the hot dog a 6.5-7 the max. I sent back in to give the sausage a try. I must say I was expecting to lay at least $5 but it was only $3.50. The sausage had some really good heat to it. The bread was just okay, would probably take this dog to another level is they put it on the grill for a minute or so. They accept card with a minimum of $6 purchase",
