					text: "Braving the line at Joe's Pizza is a rewarding experience. Though it may wind between a dozen or so people or extend around the corner, the pace is surprisingly swift, so don't be disheartened by the sight of a lengthy queue. During my visit, I indulged in the delightful variety of flavors offered, ordering four distinct toppings, each proving to be excellent.\n\nWhat sets Joe's Pizza apart is not just the efficiency of the line but also the impeccable quality of their creations. The crust, thin and crunchy with every bite, achieves a good balance with the generous layers of sauce and cheese. Having frequented both this location and others scattered throughout the city, I can attest to the consistent and delicious experience on every occasion.\n\nThis pizzeria is more than a mere eatery; it's a destination worthy of sharing with friends, coworkers, or family visiting from out of town. New York pizza, exemplified by Joe's, reigns supreme in my culinary preferences. Each slice feels like a little piece of heaven, and the service adds to the charm ‚Äì swift, kind, and attentive, always accompanied by a friendly smile. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Thank you, Joe's Pizza, for consistently delivering a slice of perfection! Yum!",

It moved along relatively quickly and in less than 30 minutes we had our pizza slices! This was on a Friday night at 5pm.\n\nIt's a big operation and very popular. There is outdoor seating right outside and another undercover area over the sidewalk. Customers generally moved on quite quickly too, so finding somewhere to eat wasn't a problem.\n\nPizzas are served by the slice or a whole pizza and you can order via their website ahead of time for a whole pizza only. We got 4 slices for 2 adults, which was a lot! We finished every crumb.\n\nIt's a well oiled machine and the staff are super friendly. Look forward to returning next visit! üçïüáÆüáπ",

We tried the cheese slices and the fresh mozzarella slice. Both were hot and delicious. Keep in mind this place only takes cash! There is an ATM outside but charges a hefty fee so come prepared!",

					text: "Didn‚Äôt expect much but I got surprised! Only take out. So the 99c/1 dollar price only applies for the basic slice with just cheese, if you want ham or olives it will cost a bit more but still cheap. I like the dough: not too thick, crispy on the outside but still soft inside. A bit oily so your hand will be greasy afterwards but worth trying.",

You literally can't pick just one. Do service was friendly and a pizza was delicious. I had a slice of ham and bacon with another slice of chicken bacon ranch. This place has to be one of my top 3. My friend ordered one slice of pepperoni and the Margarita pizza. He said it was the best he'd ever had. Does slices are very big and if you're not hungry don't order 2 slices. They offer an assortment of drinks in twenty ounce bottles. The place was nice and clean. I would have to say it was a great experience all around five stars. I will definitely come back here when i'm in times square again. I recommend if you're in the area try this little italy pizzeria out.",

The pizza flavour is ok, definitely not great.\n\nThe garlic knots were so doughy and awful when I got them the 1st time that I didn't order them again.\n\nI paid $6.52 with tax for this 1 piece of pizza as apparently just like last time I managed to choose 1 of the 2 most expensive pieces on the board. Meanwhile there is nothing to say names or prices so you know which are the actual expensive ones. No warning before it is put in the oven to reheat.\n\nWatch the bill as I believed I was overcharged (there was another guy there saying same thing) and when I brought it up I was told exceptionally rudely that it bigger. It definitely is not.\n\n1 bottle of water and 1 slice = $10 and small change. Grossly overpriced.\n\nDo yourself a favor, avoid this place and go to the deli 2 doors down who have hot food and are not straight up rude.\n\nThe service both times has been shocking, the worst I have received in New York.\n\nThe restaurant is always messy and the floor gross. Wish I had not given it a 2nd go and when he was straight up rude, I should have walked away.",

The pizza flavour is ok, definitely not great.\n\nThe garlic knots were so doughy and awful when I got them the 1st time that I didn't order them again.\n\nI paid $6.52 with tax for this 1 piece of pizza as apparently just like last time I managed to choose 1 of the 2 most expensive pieces on the board. Meanwhile there is nothing to say names or prices so you know which are the actual expensive ones. No warning before it is put in the oven to reheat.\n\nWatch the bill as I believed I was overcharged (there was another guy there saying same thing) and when I brought it up I was told exceptionally rudely that it bigger. It definitely is not.\n\n1 bottle of water and 1 slice = $10 and small change. Grossly overpriced.\n\nDo yourself a favor, avoid this place and go to the deli 2 doors down who have hot food and are not straight up rude.\n\nThe service both times has been shocking, the worst I have received in New York.\n\nThe restaurant is always messy and the floor gross. Wish I had not given it a 2nd go and when he was straight up rude, I should have walked away.",

I can get a whole sandwich for $6.50 lol! I actually told them that I walked by 3 0.99 cents slice places and they accosted me for even bringing it up.\n\nOn top of the insane price gauging and bullying you not to talk about it the place is filthy and dark.\n\nNot all of us work at the big banks that surround your location.

Once inside it‚Äôs a bit smaller than it seems and a little underwhelming. I tried their Original Margarita and their famous clam pie. The clam pie was interesting it has clams, fresh garlic, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese. If you worried about the clams don‚Äôt they don‚Äôt overpower the pizza the garlic overpowers it more. It was a pretty good pie. I would most definitely get it again and suggest it. Their margarita pizza was ok I was expecting fresh bail on it but I saw none. Their famous sauce had a different taste than their regular pizza sauce I‚Äôd say more of a subtle taste nothing really standing out I‚Äôve most definitely have had better pies than that, but apparently Frank Sinatra made famous.  I also had their garlic bread and it was a lot of garlic an overwhelming garlic flavor but I love that. I would say their pizza is most definitely some good pies 4 out of 5 but I gave a less star because of service and a dirty water glass was served at our table that we had to get replaced. Honestly I was expecting more but overall it‚Äôs most definitely better pizza than most other pizza places around.",
